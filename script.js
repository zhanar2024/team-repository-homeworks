// The Fortune Teller
// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

// Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
// Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

const numOfChildren = 5;
const partnerName = "Brad Pitt";
const geoLoc = "Los Angeles, USA";
const jobTitle = "actress";

console.log(
  `You will be an ${jobTitle} in ${geoLoc}, married to ${partnerName} with ${numOfChildren} kids`
);
